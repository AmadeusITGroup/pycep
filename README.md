# pycep

A fun little project, which has the goal to parse
[Azure Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) files.
This is still a very early stage, therefore a lot can and will change.

## Next milestones
1. Complete loop support
2. Param decorator
3. Module decorator
4. Output condition
5. Existing resource keyword
6. Module alias
7. Adding line numbers to element blocks

## Out-of-scope
- Bicep to ARM converter and vice versa
